# Middleware documentation

ValidateQuiz is middleware that validates quiz data in a request and stops requests with invalid structure before they reach the endpoint.

Invalid input is returned with an error message.

The middleware had its own repository at first, but the files were later added to the Quiz-Builder repository.
